## üåü General Questions

### What is the Azure RAG Accelerator?

The Azure RAG Accelerator is a production-ready implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Azure services. It allows organizations to build intelligent chat applications that can answer questions based on their own documents and data sources, combining the power of Azure OpenAI with enterprise-grade security and scalability.

### How does RAG work?

RAG works in two main steps:
1. **Retrieval**: When you ask a question, the system searches through your indexed documents to find relevant information
2. **Generation**: The relevant information is then sent to a language model (like GPT-4) along with your question to generate an informed, accurate response with citations

This approach reduces hallucinations and ensures responses are grounded in your actual data.

### What makes this different from other RAG implementations?

Key differentiators include:
- **Enterprise-ready**: Built for production with Azure's security, compliance, and scalability
- **Multi-source**: Supports SharePoint, blob storage, local files, and more
- **Configurable**: Extensive customization options for search, AI models, and UI
- **Observability**: Built-in monitoring, analytics, and feedback collection
- **One-click deployment**: Automated infrastructure setup with Azure Developer CLI

### What Azure services does it use?

Core services include:
- **Azure OpenAI**: For language models and embeddings
- **Azure AI Search**: For document indexing and retrieval
- **Azure Container Apps**: For hosting the application
- **Azure Blob Storage**: For document storage
- **Azure Cosmos DB**: For feedback and session data
- **Azure Application Insights**: For monitoring and analytics

- **Azure OpenAI quotas**: Typically 240K tokens/minute for standard deployments
- **Search service tier**: Basic supports ~3 queries/second, Standard much higher
- **Typical capacity**: 50-500 concurrent users depending on usage patterns

### How can I improve response times?

Optimization strategies:
1. **Reduce search scope**: Limit `top` parameter (default: 5)
2. **Use faster models**: GPT-3.5-turbo instead of GPT-4 for simple queries
3. **Optimize chunks**: Smaller chunks reduce processing time
4. **Enable caching**: Implement Redis for frequent queries
5. **Scale resources**: Increase container CPU/memory or search service tier

### What are the latency expectations?

Typical response times:
- **Simple queries**: 2-5 seconds
- **Complex queries**: 5-15 seconds
- **First query**: May be slower due to cold start
- **Factors**: Document count, chunk size, model choice, search complexity

### How does it scale with document volume?

Scaling characteristics:
- **Search performance**: Remains fast up to millions of documents
- **Index size**: Limited by search service tier
- **Processing time**: Increases linearly with document count
- **Best practices**: Use incremental indexing, batch processing
